# Listen.ai
**Listen.ai** is a multi-purpose platform designed for **speech-language pathologists (SLPs)** or those who want to access **free, open source speech language therapy**.
It offers an all-in-one solution to enhance client work with features like:

- Real-time speech recognition and feedback

- AI-powered tools

- Record keeping

- Goal setting and tracking

- And much more

## Quick Start
- Update the <a href="https://github.com/uroshm/listen/blob/main/frontend/.env">frontend/.env file</a> with your OpenRouter API key.
- Run with Docker from root directory with this command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Before you start:



- The current default AI model is deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free.
Future versions will allow users to easily choose their preferred model (issue #34).

- Please note: The Analysis Docker container may take a while to download dependencies.
Weâ€™re actively working to improve this (issue #33).
