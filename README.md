# Listen

Listen is a multi-purpose tool designed specifically for speech-language pathologists (SLPs). It provides an all-in-one solution for SLPs to enhance their work with clients through advanced features such as real-time speech recognition and testing, AI integration, record keeping, goal setting, goal tracking, and more.

## Docker
